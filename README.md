# NLP_for_VerbalBehavior

Natural language processing is refers to a suite of computational tecniques for developing insight into verbal behavior. Skinner's book, Verbal Behavior, was a seminal text that outlined how an operant approach to verbal behavior can account for human language. Despite the prominence of written-textual behavior in current society, and the robust research literature on an operant approach to verbal behavior, surprisingly little research has been conducted on written-textual behavior. The purpose of this project is take an initial deep-dive into a quantitative, computational, and functional analysis of written-textual behavior. It can get no more meta than to do so on the book that outlined in detail a functional approach to verbal behavior. 

### Prerequisites

The documents available here are pretty straight forward. One: a .txt file of Skinner's Verbal Behavior. Two: several Python scripts that allow you to play around with the book. This means you will need to have some kind of text editor (e.g., Word, NotePad) on your computer if you want to to double check the book and edit any typos. This also means you will need to have some kind Python interpreter or IDE installed on your computer (e.g., Anaconda, PyCharm, IPython). 

## Python Scripts

One of the Python scripts is titled, "VB_NLP_main."  This has all of the other scripts in it and is a collection of what others have done. 

All other scripts are stand alone analyses and are titled, "VB_NLP_[analysis]". These are available so you can check out and run a single analysis if you so choose.
